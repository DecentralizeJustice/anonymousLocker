#### Refund Policy
The only personal data that I collect about you is your IP address. I do not personally collect your IP address but our website service provider,
Netlify does record and have access to your IP address. My file host, currently Cloudinary, also collects your IP address when you use our website. It is recommended to use a VPN to reduce the amount of information collected on you. Netlify also collects information like what website referred you.
