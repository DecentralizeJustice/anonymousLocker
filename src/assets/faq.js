                You should also be sure to copy the item link when you are not signed in to your account. 
                If you copy a link when you are signed in to your account you might leak information such as your wishlist and account name.`

        ['How Does This Work?', 
        `Here is a basic outline of how ordering with anonymous locker works:
        <ol>
            <li>You find products from Amazon that you would like to purchase.</li>
            <li>You place an order at my website.</li>
            <li>I place an  order for the items that you chose to an amazon locker near you.</li>
            <li>I will use my website's built-in chat function to message you about your order. </li>
            <li>I then message you the locker code when your order is delivered to the amazon locker.</li>
            <li>You pick up your order from the amazon locker using the code you received via my site.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your item, without anyone else knowing what you bought, your home address, or any other private information.</li>
        </ol>
        I also have a full demo of Anonymous Locker <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dylevfpbl/video/upload/v1669001384/Untitled.mp4">here</a>.`

        ['How Much is This Service?',
        `My service is 3% on top of the amazon order subtotal plus a flat 5 dollar base service fee. My service assumes that the sales tax
        charged by amazon is 8%. This is higher than most purchases will experience, 
        so I will gladly refund you any extra taxes you pay once I place your order
        and get the exact amount.`

        ['Why Should I hide my shipping address?', 
        `Let's say you wanted to buy a hardware wallet. 
                If you order from a retailer they will have your address and they could leak that information.

                death threats due to these leaks. 
                You should not be punished for securing your crypto. 
                My service helps hide your address to prevent leaks like this.
                This is just one example of why you need to protect your shipping and order information.`

                <li>Items must be fulfilled by amazon since only amazon can ship to amazon lockers.</li>

                <li>The minimum order is 25 dollars.</li>
                <li>I can not purchase prime-only items. This includes things like Prime Exclusive Deals.</li>
                <li>We do not offer free Prime 2-Day Shipping, but you can pay extra for faster if you so wish.</li>
                <li> I reserve the right to decline to process an order. In this case, a refund will be issued.</li>
                <li> You should check your order every other day so that you do not miss important information about your order.</li>

            `Is this service Anonymous?`, `No, no service can be truly anonymous. There will always be metadata leaks. 
            Amazon lockers and the business they are in have cameras. This service is as slightly more anonymous than going to a store and spending cash. 
            If you want the best anonymity when picking up your order you should wear a face mask, hat and glasses ðŸ˜Ž.

            `People have been ordering to amazon lockers as a way to accomplish some privacy for years. This process can be highly variable due to Amazon's anti-fraud detection methods. 
            Using a prepaid credit card with a fresh account could result in triggering amazon's anti-fraud detection. I would recommend a prepaid card, residential proxy, burner phone number, burner email and browser emulator like multi-login or incognito if you do this process yourself.
             You might still trigger their anti-fraud detection though, so your mileage will vary. If you have fiat, it would be much easier and safer to just convert that fiat to cash and buy an item in person.`

            you can pay for it with cash in person and still protect your identity. `
