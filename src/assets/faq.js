            `Couldn't I just ship my orders to a amazon locker myself?`, 
            `People have been ordering to amazon lockers as a way to accomplish some privacy for years. This process can be highly variable due to amazons anti-fraud detection methods. Using a prepaid credit card with a fresh account, could result in triggering amazon's anti-fraud detection. I would recomend a prepaid card, residential proxy, burner phone number, burner email and browser emulator like multi-login or incognito if you do this proccess yourself. You might still trigger thier anti fraud detection though, so your milage will vary. If you have fiat, it would be much easier and safer to just convert that fiat to cash and buy an item in person.`
