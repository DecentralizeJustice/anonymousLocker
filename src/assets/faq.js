        ['How Does This Work?', 
        `Here is a basic outline of how ordering with anonymous locker works:
        <ol>
            <li>You find products from Amazon that you would like to purchase.</li>
            <li>You place an order at my website.</li>
            <li>I place an  order for the items that you chose to an amazon locker near you.</li>
            <li>I use the my websites built in chat funtion to message you about your order. </li>
            <li>I then message you the locker code when your order is deliverd to the amazon locker.</li>
            <li>You pick up your order from the amazon locker using the code you received via my site.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your item, without anyone else knowing what you bought, your home address, or any other private information.</li>
        </ol>

        ['How Much is This Service?',
        `My service is 15 Dollars and 2% on top of the amazon order subtotal. For example, if you were to buy a 100 dollar hardware wallet from amazon
        my service would cost you 118 dollars. At checkout with me you would pay 118 USD worth of monero.`

        ['Why Should I hide my shipping address?', 
        `Lets say you wanted to buy a hardware wallet. 
                If you order from a retailer they will have your address and they could possibly leak that information.

                death threats due to these leaks. 
                You should not punished for securing your crypto. 
                My service helps hide your address to prevent leaks like this.
                This is just one example of why you need to protect your shipping and order information.`

            If you wish to return an item, we will arrange for you to return an item to the locker. 
            Once amazon successfully refunds to the item, I will refund you the same usd worth of monero that you paid me minus the 2% service charge.`

    'Alternative Methods':

        [
            `Couldn't I just ship my orders to a amazon locker myself?`, 
            `People have been ordering to amazon lockers as a way to accomplish some privacy for years. This process can be highly variable due to amazons anti-fraud detection methods. 
            Using a prepaid credit card with a fresh account, could result in triggering amazon's anti-fraud detection. I would recommend a prepaid card, residential proxy, burner phone number, burner email and browser emulator like multi-login or incognito if you do this process yourself.
             You might still trigger their anti fraud detection though, so your mileage will vary. If you have fiat, it would be much easier and safer to just convert that fiat to cash and buy an item in person.`

            you can pay for it with cash in person and still protect your identity. `
