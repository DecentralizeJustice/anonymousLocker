        ['How Much is This Service?',
        `My service is 5 Dollars and 2% on top of the amazon order subtotal. For example, if you were to buy a 100 dollar (after amazon's taxes) hardware wallet from amazon.
        , My service would cost you 7 dollars. At checkout with me you would pay 107 dollars of monero to me. I also always use the free shipping option. If you
        need a faster method, just message me and we can work it out.`

        ['Why Should I hide my shipping address?', 
        `Lets say you wanted to buy a hardware wallet. 
                If you order from a retailer they will have your address and they could possibly leak that information. 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Ledger</a>

                death threats due to these leaks. 
                You should not punished for securing your crypto. 
                My service helps hide your address to prevent leaks like this.
                This is just one example of why you need to protect your shipping and order information.`

             or have received the product you will receive a amazon gift card when you process the return. I can trade this amazon gift card for monero for you, for 2% fee.`

            `Couldn't I just ship my orders to a amazon locker myself?`, 
            `People have been ordering to amazon lockers as a way to accomplish some privacy for years. This process can be highly variable due to amazons anti-fraud detection methods. 
            Using a prepaid credit card with a fresh account, could result in triggering amazon's anti-fraud detection. I would recommend a prepaid card, residential proxy, burner phone number, burner email and browser emulator like multi-login or incognito if you do this process yourself.
             You might still trigger their anti fraud detection though, so your mileage will vary. If you have fiat, it would be much easier and safer to just convert that fiat to cash and buy an item in person.`

            you can pay for it with cash in person and still protect your identity. `
