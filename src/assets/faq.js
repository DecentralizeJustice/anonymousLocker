      `Can I use tor with your site?`,

    ],
    [
      `When do I enter my address?`,
      `You pay and then we check your order and get it ready for our earners. 
      After we check over it, we message you again in chat to get your address. 
      Doing things this way ensures that we only collect your sensitive information( such as your address) 
      when we know for 100% certainty we can complete your order. 
      We would hate for you to give us sensitive info for an order that we can not process.`,

  "Locker Questions": [
    [
      `Can you do International Orders?`,
      `Yes. We can not deliver outside of your country's Amazon Site though. For example, we can not deliver from US Amazon to Japan Amazon.

      `Should I use tor with this service?`,
      `If you want the best anonymity possible then you should use tor. 
                You should also be sure to copy the item link when you are not signed in to your account. 
                If you copy a link when you are signed in to your account you might leak information such as your wishlist and account name.`,

      `How long does it take to process an order?`,
      `I aim to process all orders within 12 hours.`,
    ],
    [

      "How Does This Work?",
      `Here is a basic outline of how ordering with Anon Shop works:
        <ol>
            <li>You find products from Amazon that you would like to purchase.</li>
            <li>You place an order at my website.</li>
            <li>I place an  order for the items that you chose to an amazon locker near you.</li>
            <li>I will use my website's built-in chat function to message you about your order. </li>
            <li>I then message you the locker code when your order is delivered to the amazon locker.</li>
            <li>You pick up your order from the amazon locker using the code you received via my site.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your item, without anyone else knowing what you bought, your home address, or any other private information.</li>
        </ol>
        I also have a full demo of Anonymous Locker <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dylevfpbl/video/upload/v1669001384/Untitled.mp4">here</a>.`,
    ],
    [
      "How Much is This Service?",
      `My service is 3% on top of the amazon order subtotal plus a flat 5 dollar base service fee. My service assumes that the sales tax
        charged by amazon is 8%. This is higher than most purchases will experience, 
        so I will gladly refund you any extra taxes you pay once I place your order
        and get the exact amount.`,
    ],
    [
      "Why Should I hide my shipping address?",
      `Let's say you wanted to buy a hardware wallet. 
                If you order from a retailer they will have your address and they could leak that information.

                have both leaked customer information in the past.

                death threats due to these leaks. 
                You should not be punished for securing your crypto. 
                My service helps hide your address to prevent leaks like this.
                This is just one example of why you need to protect your shipping and order information.`,
    ],
    [
      `What are some of the limitations and stipulations of your service?`,
      `Some current limitations of my service are:
            <ol>
                <li>Items must be fulfilled by amazon since only amazon can ship to amazon lockers.</li>
                <li>We do not offer refunds unless there is an error on our end.</li>
                <li>We offer returns for delivered items at our discretion.</li>
                <li>The minimum order is 25 dollars.</li>
                <li>I can not purchase prime-only items. This includes things like Prime Exclusive Deals.</li>
                <li>We do not offer free Prime 2-Day Shipping, but you can pay extra for faster if you so wish.</li>
                <li> I reserve the right to decline to process an order. In this case, a refund will be issued.</li>
                <li> You should check your order every other day so that you do not miss important information about your order.</li>
            </ol>`,

    [
      `Is this service Anonymous?`,
      `No, no service can be truly anonymous. There will always be metadata leaks. 
            Amazon lockers and the business they are in have cameras. This service is as slightly more anonymous than going to a store and spending cash. 
            If you want the best anonymity when picking up your order you should wear a face mask, hat and glasses ðŸ˜Ž. 
            Or any other clothing to protect your identity.`,

      'Yes, here is the <a href="https://github.com/DecentralizeJustice/anonymousLocker">github</a> repo for the code.',

    [
      `What happens If I don't pick my order up from the locker?`,
      `If you don't pick up your order you will lose your funds. If you can not pick up your orders, I would recommend you use the home delivery option.
            `,
    ],
    [
      `Are there size restrictions?`,
      `Yes. Large items such as printers or a bulk order of a product might not fit in the locker.
            If the order does not fit, we will issue a full refund.

    [
      `Couldn't I just ship my orders to an amazon locker myself?`,
      `People have been ordering to amazon lockers as a way to accomplish some privacy for years. This process can be highly variable due to Amazon's anti-fraud detection methods. 
            Using a prepaid credit card with a fresh account could result in triggering amazon's anti-fraud detection. I would recommend a prepaid card, residential proxy, burner phone number, burner email and browser emulator like multi-login or incognito if you do this process yourself.
             You might still trigger their anti-fraud detection though, so your mileage will vary. If you have fiat, it would be much easier and safer to just convert that fiat to cash and buy an item in person.`,
