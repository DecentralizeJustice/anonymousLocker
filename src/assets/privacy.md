#### Personal Data That Is Collected
The only personal data that we collect about you is your IP address. we do not personally collect your IP address but our website service provider,
Netlify does record and have access to your IP address. My file host, currently Cloudinary, also collects your IP address when you use our website. It is recommended to use a VPN to reduce the amount of information collected on you. Netlify also collects information like what website referred you. We also use plausible.io for web traffic analytics. 
#### Personal Data That Might Be Collected
When you use amazon in conjunction with our service they will collect information about you. We do not have access to this information. Amazon deploys a lot of tracking, and it is recommended to use a tor browser to avoid this tracking. We have a demonstration video on how to do this on our youtube channel. All amazon lockers have cameras built in and they will probably record you picking up your package. We do not have access to any of this recorded video.
If you wish to avoid the camera's you can wear a face mask, glasses or another disguise that fits your taste.
#### General Data That Is Collected
By the function of our service when you use our service, we will have access to the following data about you.  
    <ol>
    <li>The payment crypto address that you paid me with, depends on the crypto that you use.</li>

The payment processor that we use can also have access to the payment address that you used to pay with, depending on the cryptocurrency that you used to pay with. 
#### How Long We Keep This Data
We will keep the data that is collected on you indefinitely. We need to be able to prove to the authorities that our business was legitimate and above board. An audit by an authority can happen at any time, so we keep this aforementioned data for these reasons. We delete the chat logs around a day after your order has been resolved.
