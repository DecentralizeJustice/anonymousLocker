#### Personal Data That Is Collected
The only personal data that I collect about you is your IP address. I do not personally collect your IP address but our website service provider,
Netlify does record and have access to your IP address. My file host, currently Cloudinary, also collects your IP address when you use our website. It is recommended to use a VPN to reduce the amount of information collected on you. 
#### Personal Data That Might Be Collected
When you use amazon in conjunction with my service they will collect information about you. I do not have access to this information. Amazon deploys a lot of tracking, and it is recommended to use a tor browser to avoid this tracking. I have a demonstration video on how to do this on my landing page.
#### General Data That Is Collected
By the function of my service when you use my service, I will have access to the following data about you.  
    <ol>
    <li>The payment crypto address that you paid me with, depending on the crypto that you use.</li>
    <li>The items that you bought.</li>
    <li>The amazon locker that you used to pick these items up from.</li>
    <li>The time that you picked up your order(s).</li>
    <li>Any other information that you tell me. I discourage giving me extra info about yourself.</li>
    </ol>
The payment processor that I use can also have access to the payment address that you used to pay with, depending on the cryptocurrency that you used to pay with. 
#### How Long I Keep This Data
I will keep the data that is collected on you indefinitely. I need to be able to prove to the authorities that my business was legitimate and above board. An audit by an authority can happen at any time, so I keep this aforementioned data for these reasons. 
#### Who I Share Your Data With
I do not share this data with anyone unless I am required to by law. This might happen in a civil or criminal situation.
#### Policy Updates
This policy might change in the future. If it does it will update on this site.
